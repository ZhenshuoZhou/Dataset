As GitHub imposes restrictions on the size of uploaded files, only representative samples are presented here. The full dataset is available for download from our server at: http://blogcenter.top/zzs/index.html
As the server resources are limited, the download speed may be relatively slow. The public dataset used in this study is a subset derived from COCO2017. Alternatively, the original COCO dataset can be accessed via the following link: http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip
